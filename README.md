A grouping of Sisense scripts

**hideFilterOptions**
This dashboard script will hide selected options from the dashboard filters pane, while keeping the filter selection off or on as it was selected <br />
To use, simply turn your filter on or off, then add the names of the filters you'd like to hide to the hiddenFilters list <br />
PLEASE NOTE That this script will scroll through all filters and dashboard items as they fall under the same class, but rarely in use cases will dashboard names be the same as filter names  <br />
